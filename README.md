# DSA210_term-project

In this project I intend to find a relation between geographical relations between countries' living standards and geographical properties. I believe living standarts and geographical information of the country can be poven relevant. I will be using a dataset that I have found on kaggle regarding the living standartds and will create a different dataset consisting of geographical data like region average temperature ect. The datasets I have been using will be mentioned melow with the specific way that I am using them.

Datasets:

    this is the main dataset, I will be using this and try to find geographical metrics that are related.
