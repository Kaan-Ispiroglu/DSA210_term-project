# **DSA210 Term Project: Analyzing the Relationship Between Geography and Living Standards**

## **Project Overview**
In this project, I aim to explore the relationship between a country's geographical properties and its living standards. I hypothesize that geographical factors such as climate, region, and environmental conditions play a significant role in shaping the quality of life in different countries.

To test this hypothesis, I will analyze a dataset on global living standards and supplement it with geographical data, including factors such as **average temperature, elevation, proximity to water bodies, and climate classification.** Using data analysis and visualization techniques, I will assess whether there is a measurable correlation between geography and quality of life.

The project will involve **data preprocessing, feature engineering, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing** to determine which geographical factors have the most influence on living standards.

## **Motivation**
Understanding the impact of geography on living standards can provide valuable insights into **economic development, policy-making, and resource allocation.** By leveraging data science techniques, I want to uncover **patterns and trends** that might explain why certain regions consistently perform better in terms of quality of life.

### **Key Motivations**
- **Personal Interest**: Exploring the intersection of geography, economics, and data science.
- **Practical Applications**: Identifying geographical factors that influence development can help in urban planning and policymaking.
- **Academic Learning**: Applying the concepts from the DSA210 course to a real-world dataset and improving my data analysis skills.

## **Methodology**
This project will follow a structured data analysis approach:

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Load and clean the **Quality of Life dataset** from Kaggle.
- Collect additional geographical data (e.g., climate, temperature, elevation).
- Merge datasets to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use **visualizations** (heatmaps, scatter plots, box plots) to identify trends.
- Compute **summary statistics** to understand distributions.
- Identify potential **outliers** and missing values.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features from geographical data (e.g., temperature ranges, elevation categories).
- Normalize data for better comparison.

### **4. Correlation & Hypothesis Testing**
- Apply **correlation matrices** to check relationships between geographical features and living standards.
- Conduct **statistical tests** (e.g., Pearsonâ€™s correlation, regression analysis) to validate findings.

### **5. Visualization & Interpretation**
- Generate **maps, scatter plots, and regression plots** to present findings.
- Interpret the results and discuss potential causations.

### **6. Conclusion & Insights**
- Summarize key takeaways.
- Discuss **potential limitations** of the dataset and methodology.
- Propose **future research directions** or policy implications.

## **Datasets**
I will be using the following datasets:

### **1. [Quality of Life for Each Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/quality-of-life-for-each-country)**  
- This is the primary dataset, containing **various indicators of living standards**, such as health, economic prosperity, education, and safety.  
- I will analyze how these indicators vary across different countries and regions.

### **2. Geographical Data (To be compiled separately)**  
- I will create a custom dataset with the following geographical features:
  - **Average annual temperature**
  - **Elevation above sea level**
  - **Climate classification (e.g., tropical, temperate, arid)**
  - **Proximity to coastlines or large water bodies**
  - **Natural disaster frequency (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes)**  
- These metrics will be sourced from publicly available datasets (to be listed in detail later).

## **Tools & Technologies**
For this project, I will use the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: Main programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Feature engineering and machine learning models (if applicable).
- **GeoPandas & Folium**: Geospatial data analysis and mapping.
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

## **Expected Outcomes**
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

1. **Which geographical factors have the strongest correlation with living standards?**
2. **Is there a measurable impact of climate (temperature, precipitation) on quality of life?**
3. **Do coastal or higher-elevation regions have a better standard of living?**
4. **Can a predictive model be built to estimate living standards based on geography?**

These findings could provide insights into **economic planning, resource distribution, and the broader relationship between geography and human well-being.**

---

## **Next Steps**
- Finalize **geographical dataset sources**.
- Merge and clean the datasets.
- Begin **EDA and correlation analysis**.
- Run **statistical tests and visualizations**.
- Interpret the results and document findings.
